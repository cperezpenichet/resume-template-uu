	abstract = {While the penetration of objects into granular media is well-studied, there is little understanding of how objects settle in gravities, geff, different from that of Earth—a scenario potentially relevant to the geomorphology of planets and asteroids and also to their exploration using man-made devices. By conducting experiments in an accelerating frame, we explore geff ranging from 0.4 g to 1.2 g. Surprisingly, we find that the rest depth is independent of geff and also that the time required for the object to come to rest scales like geff−1/2. With discrete element modeling simulations, we reproduce the experimental results and extend the range of geff to objects as small as asteroids and as large as Jupiter. Our results shed light on the initial stage of sedimentation into dry granular media across a range of celestial bodies and also have implications for the design of man-made, extraterrestrial vehicles and structures.},

	abstract = {The widely extended {WLAN} infrastructure has often been used as geographic landmark to support localization applications and human mobility studies. In these applications a {WiFi} network made of static nodes seems to be always assumed. Here, evidence is presented to show that this is hardly ever the case. Several independently collected datasets were analyzed to show that dynamic, moving Access Points are often present and could have a significant negative impact in this kind of applications. Additionally other irregularities in these traces are also exposed. The possible impact of these irregularities is evaluated in one specific application, Proximity Maps. The node degree distribution of Proximity Maps is studied and the influence of the proposed solution on the degree distribution is analyzed. Finally some possible simple solutions to mitigate the problem are presented.},

	abstract = {Activity rhythms in animal groups arise both from external changes in the environment, as well as from internal group dynamics. These cycles are reminiscent of physical and chemical systems with quasiperiodic and even chaotic behavior resulting from “autocatalytic” mechanisms. We use nonlinear differential equations to model how the coupling between the self-excitatory interactions of individuals and external forcing can produce four different types of activity rhythms: quasiperiodic, chaotic, phase locked, and displaying over or under shooting. At the transition between quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes, activity cycles are asymmetrical, with rapid activity increases and slower decreases and a phase shift between external forcing and activity. We find similar activity patterns in ant colonies in response to varying temperature during the day. Thus foraging ants operate in a region of quasiperiodicity close to a cascade of transitions leading to chaos. The model suggests that a wide range of temporal structures and irregularities seen in the activity of animal and human groups might be accounted for by the coupling between collectively generated internal clocks and external forcings.},

	abstract = {Ants, as paradigm of social insects, have become a recurrent example of efficient problem solvers
via self-organization. In spite of the simple behavior of each individual, the colony as a whole displays “swarm intelligence:” the organization of ant trails for foraging is a typical output of it. But conventional techniques of observation can hardly record the amount of data needed to get a detailed understanding of self-organization of ant swarms in the wild. Here we are presenting a measurement system intended to monitor ant activity in the field comprising massive data acquisition and high sensitivity. A central role is played by an infrared sensor devised specifically to monitor relevant parameters to the activity of ants through the exits of the nest, although other sensors detecting temperature and luminosity are added to the system. We study the characteristics of the activity sensor and its performance in the field. Finally, we present massive data measured at one exit of a nest of Atta insularis, an ant endemic to Cuba, to illustrate the potential of our system.},

metry is broken: the bacterial concentration gets higher immediately after passing the

mum. Symmetry is not violated, however, in the case of dead or poorly active bacteria.
The phenomena can be explained qualitatively in terms of hydrodynamic interactions
of bacteria with the imposed flow and with other bacteria. Our observations suggests
a simple way to concentrate very active bacteria in microfluidic channels.},

	abstract = {Dispersion and migration of bacteria under flow in tortuous and confined structures such as porous or fractured materials is related to a large spectrum of practical interest, but is still poorly understood. Here, we address the question of transport and dispersion of an E. coli suspension flowing through a micro-fluidic channel with a funnel-like constriction in its center. We show a counter-intuitive symmetry
breaking of the bacterial concentration, which increases significantly past the funnel. This concentration enhancement persists over large distances from the funnel and disappears at large flow rate values. We map our results onto a one dimensional convection–diffusion equation predicting quantitatively the experimental results, without free parameters, when a conservative non-local source term is introduced. This last term, measured experimentally, represents a long range memory effect due to the unbalance of wall adsorption and desorption processes past the constriction. Our model experiment points out the generic importance of considering such constriction effects in the description of transport properties of active matter in porous media. It also opens the possibility to control the concentration of bacterial suspensions in micro-fluidic channels by simply tuning the flow intensity or direction.},

The scalability of this technique has been questioned in regards to the maximum temporal misalignment among baseband signals, due to the variety of path delays in the network. By contrast, we find that the scalability is compromised, in the first place, by emerging fast fading in the composite channel, which originates in the carrier frequency disparity of the participating repeaters nodes. We investigate the multisource wave problem and show the resulting signal becomes vulnerable in the presence of noise, leading to significant deterioration of the link whenever the carriers have similar amplitudes.},
